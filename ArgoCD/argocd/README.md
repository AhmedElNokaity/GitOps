ArgoCD
=========

Automating ArgoCD Deployment on Kubernetes cluster using Helm.

Requirements
------------

- The following pip packages must be present 
```bash
pip3 install openshift pyyaml kubernetes --user
```

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:
```yaml
- hosts: localhost
  roles:
  - argocd
```
